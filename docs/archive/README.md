# docs/archive/

This folder contains files that were either:
- Temporary fix guides no longer needed
- Status files from completed dev phases
- Root-level markdown files that polluted the repo root

All files here are **read-only historical references**. Do not edit them.
Do not add new files here unless archiving something explicitly.
